		"body": "This project is probably one of my favorite pieces. Not only is it the first project that I have successfully shipped and created, but it also has evolved with me.\n\nAt first, it started as a Ruby on Rails project. Then as my skills grew a little more, I turned it into an Express/Node.js project. Then I discovered the joys of Angular and Mongodb, so I turned it into a very basic SPA utilizing the MEAN stack. And now, I am in the process of turning it into an app built on Vue.js/Nuxt.js.\n\nThroughout this whole process, the client has been a tremendous joy to work for. Patient in areas where the new technology takes a little time to implement and always up for joining me in the improvement process.\n\nThe goal of this project was simple: a new law firm needed a website to be able to showcase who they are and how to connect with them. I created a couple prototypes of what direction to take the website in and she really liked my idea for a website that had space and breathing room. I took that design prototype and simply converted into the equivalent HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website she currently sports today.",

		"body": "This project really stands out to me because it was a project birthed out of the desire to improve processes. While working as an office manager for an Auto Repair Shop, I found myself losing out on a lot of time because they were still doing things in a very inefficient manner. A simple example was the fact that they were still signing people in by hand.\n\nSo what was my solution? Simple: build the business I was working for a web application to start streamlining a lot of their processes to make us more efficient.",
